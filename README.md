UI/UX Design Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio that I'm using to apply for jobs. I have been studying web development for a year now, and I used the skills I learned from courses and teaching myself to design my own website and launch it through GitHub Pages.

I wanted my website to have a creative and ambitious aesthetic, so I included a lot of content that either I created or have been featured in. I even drew the background pencil sketches of the stars, bubbles, and sparkles. You can see my Figma designs here: https://www.figma.com/design/tWuET2UJijZUq3NxvEj5Za/Portfolio-Websites?node-id=2017-639&t=doAATvAkcYU3yCSn-0

This portfolio highlights my experience in communicating information effectively with a non-technical audience, as well as connecting with people in real time or on the algorithm through online platforms. I expect that roles like technical writing, UX researching, and A&R scouting would be where my experience would be most beneficial.

TODO:
- Fix spacing of the content in the experience and projects pages (content on first row is too close to content on second row)
- Add rules that adjust content based on window size
