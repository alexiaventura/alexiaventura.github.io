UI/UX Design Portfolio

This is my portfolio for UI/UX job applications. I used the skills I learned from web development courses and teaching myself to design my own website and launch it through GitHub Pages.

I wanted my website to have a creative and ambitious aesthetic, so I included a lot of content that either I created or have been featured in. I even drew the background pencil sketches of the stars, bubbles, music notes, and sparkles. You can see my Figma designs here: https://www.figma.com/design/tWuET2UJijZUq3NxvEj5Za/Portfolio-Websites?node-id=2017-639&t=doAATvAkcYU3yCSn-0

This portfolio highlights my experience in communicating information effectively with a non-technical audience, as well as applying my UI/UX knowledge in the music industry especially. I expect that roles like technical writing, UI/UX designing, and UX researching would be where my experience is most beneficial.

A lot of this project was asking Copilot how to code what my Figma design has, and then cleaning up and studying the program, so this helped me improve my understanding of web development significantly.
