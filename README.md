UI/UX Design Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio that I'm using to apply for jobs. I have been studying web development for a year now, and I used the skills I learned from courses and teaching myself to design my own website and launch it through GitHub Pages.

I wanted my website to have a creative and ambitious aesthetic, so I included a lot of content that either I created or have been featured in. I even drew the background pencil sketches of the stars, bubbles, and sparkles. You can see my Figma designs here: https://www.figma.com/design/tWuET2UJijZUq3NxvEj5Za/Portfolio-Websites?node-id=2017-639&t=doAATvAkcYU3yCSn-0

This portfolio highlights my experience in communicating information effectively with a non-technical audience, as well as connecting with people in real time or on the algorithm through online platforms. I expect that roles like technical writing, UX researching, and A&R scouting would be where my experience would be most beneficial.

A lot of this project was asking Copilot how to code what my Figma design has, and then cleaning up and studying the program, so this helped me improve my understanding of web development significantly.
