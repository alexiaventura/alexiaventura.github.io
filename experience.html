                <p>Irvine, CA | Mentor, Tutor | September 2022 - June 2025</p>
                <button class="accordion">✨ What I did</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>For 6 academic quarters as a "Tutorial Leader," I held 1-hour tutorial sessions independently
                        with various numbers of students. On average, I would have around 3-5
                        students enrolled per tutorial. I supported two beginner Python programming
                        classes at UCI, ICS 31 and ICS 32. I also held review sessions when students had exams or
                        projects.
                        </br></br>I was promoted to the "Mentor" role in my second year at LARC, where I helped
                        co-lead a staff meeting, host a social event, evaluate tutorial sessions, and rewrite the Zoom
                        training documentation.
                        </br></br>Due to scheduling conflicts, I stepped down from the "Tutorial Leader" and "Mentor"
                        roles in my third and final year at LARC, but continued to support LARC as a "LARC After Dark"
                        tutor. In that role, I helped students in weekly, 2 hour drop-in sessions, and often answered
                        questions
                        using the whiteboard to visualize concepts. I helped students debug their projects thanks to
                        this.
                        </br></br>I was hired for LARC right after changing majors to computer science and
                        after only having 4 programming classes of experience, so I was still very new with programming
                        and would be honest with students. A lot of students related with this and asked me for advice.
                        I was also open about discussing when I repeated classes, as some of my students also related to
                        that.

                <button class="accordion">✨ Examples of my work</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>For every tutorial, I made original worksheets based on the instructor's lesson plans
                        and my learning style. You can view examples of my best ones here.
                        (Fun fact: the conditional statement worksheet's first draft was what I
                        used for this job's interview.)
                        </br></br>I also helped with redesigning and updating the <a
                            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVl6KdFtW_4K6y7iiPjNHC3iKIdolXNh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108809680301142076339&rtpof=true&sd=true">Zoom
                            tutorial training documentation</a>, based on style guidelines I was asked to follow (such
                        as using bookmarks).</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">✨ My teaching style</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>To help students participate actively, I
                        explained concepts and guided them with questions directly on the whiteboard, and then they
                        would try coding questions on their computer. After
                        tutorial sessions, I would upload answer keys with additional information.
                        </br></br>I also created lesson plans for myself to manage my time.
                        Given the 1-hour time constraint, I eventually simplified my worksheet
                        and checked in with students directly to avoid overspending time on the guided
                        practice and icebreaker.
                        </br></br>Most of my students were in their first year of college,
                        changing majors, or new to programming, so they were often under stress. To
                        help them relax, I often brought candy and Play-Doh to tutorial sessions.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I am honored to say that due to my involvement at LARC, I was given the "Helper of the
                        People" award in the Discord server that many UCI computer science students use for networking
                        and planning.
                        </br></br>I am also in a few social media posts, as I often
                        volunteered my time to promote the activities I participated in. You can
                        see my Instagram post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6MwD29yj2q/"

                <p>Costa Mesa, CA | Carnival Ticket Seller | July 2025 - August 2025</p>
                <button class="accordion">✨ What I did</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>For the entire 2025 OC Fair, I sold tickets at various booths at night. Every
                        day was different because of the timing, location of the booth, and whether the
                        booth accepted cash or not.
                        </br></br>Being interested in business and hospitality, I wanted to get more
                        experience with it as well as with cash handling. This job helped me obtain those
                        skills quickly. I learned how to multitask, work in a fast-paced environment, and
                        respond to customer complaints while maintaining an accurate balance. I also learned
                        from my mistakes and setbacks quickly. For instance, after being $0.50 short of change
                        for a customer, I learned how to be prepared for payments with coins and have since
                        achieved a perfect balance after every shift.
                        </br></br>I am also now familiar with using a POS system and ticket printer, as well as
                        checking for counterfeit money.

                <button class="accordion">✨ But I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yes, I don't think you'd expect a recent computer science graduate
                        to do this as a first job since graduation. I actually started this
                        job as a student; I was finishing my last two GE classes in online summer
                        school to get my degree. I finished my degree halfway through this job.
                        </br></br>However, I really wanted to do this job, as I
                        feel like knowing these skills are fundamental to future business roles. I didn't
                        do it as a high school or college student, so I might as well do it now.

                <p>Beverly Hills, CA | Business Affairs/Production Intern | January 2025 - June 2025</p>
                <button class="accordion">✨ What I did</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I helped redesign the landing page and make an FAQ
                        page for APG's music distributor service, Release Global. I started with some Figma designs
                        and then found a website builder to implement it easily without coding experience (Framer, which
                        I chose over Wix and Squarespace after experimenting and feedback). I also wrote the user
                        manuals for updating the landing page and FAQ page, as I also used an
                        external tool called Common Ninja to embed some of the widgets.
                        </br></br>I also helped my supervisor fill a spreadsheet
                        with information about APG's artist YouTube videos and the ISRC codes for the featured music.
                        I realized this task would be completed faster if I used the YouTube API, but I didn't have much
                        API experience. Therefore, this started as an experiment using Copilot, and I used that as a
                        starting point to
                        teach myself how to access the API with Python. I cleaned the code up and added in some more
                        logic to enable
                        reading a text file of YouTube channel handles, calling the API to get all video titles,
                        filtering
                        out shorts, and
                        writing
                        the output to a CSV file. This saved a lot of time in populating the spreadsheet and allowed me
                        to
                        focus on getting the ISRC codes from the OpenPlay catalog. In case APG uses it, I gave them the
                        code and wrote a README file to explain how to use the program.
                        </br></br>I also helped with a content creator webinar by using my personal experience to
                        suggest good questions about posting on social media. (I can tell you these questions were good,
                        because I tried the advice from the answers and grew my own audience immediately.)

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Once APG updates their Release Global website, you can see it
                        <a href="https://www.release.global/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        (As of when this website is live, it isn't updated)
                        </br></br>I'm going to ask if I can also share my Figma designs, API program, and
                        the user manuals here.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                    <p>The best surprise of my computer science education by far was
                        how I was still able to incorporate my music interests. Having this
                        internship was one of the ways that happened. Usually people told me
                        to get a conventional software engineering internship, but I'm like: I
                        want to see if my major can be used in a different path than that.
                        I didn't even apply to very many internships in fall 2024, in fact, and
                        got this one.
                        </br></br>For 6 months, I drove from my hometown (Huntington Beach) to
                        west Los Angeles to do this academic credit internship, at most 4 hours total of driving twice
                        a week. Due to also attending UC Irvine full-time, sometimes
                        I had scheduling conflicts and worked remotely, but I came in-person as much as
                        possible. This internship wasn't easy to do while still going to school, but it was worth it.
                        This was the first time I worked in a record label, and I enjoyed it so much that I hope I will
                        work in one again.

                        language processing.
                        </br></br>Honestly, I wasn't as active in this group project as ideal since I started to have
                        scheduling conflicts at school. Nevertheless, I did some data cleaning through Google Colab and
                        some of the user interface implementation (a Figma mockup and using Plotly Dash, including
                        adding a
