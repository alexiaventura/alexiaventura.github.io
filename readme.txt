--Readme document for Alexia Ventura--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

Using Bootstrap

(c) Advanced features
A table (following along with the professor's example directly)

Parallax scrolling animation (I uploaded a PDF of the CodePath resource I used, since it requires logging in to see it)

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
24

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I took the CodePath WEB101 class this past fall, which gave me basic experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I looked at the code I used for that class's project to help me with syntax for some of my website's features, especially parallax scrolling animation (the stars move when you scroll) at the top. I checked with Professor Epstein in person about citing it, which I did by mentioning how I used it in the code comments, as well as uploading a PDF of that resource onto this repository. (CodePath requires logging in to see the resources, so I downloaded the resource to let you see it without me logging in.)

I also referred to W3schools' documentation for other syntax and to also cite the CodePath code. I didn't cite every single thing when it became general HTML/CSS knowledge, but since I have some experience prior to this class or needed to refresh my memory, I looked up some sources. They are also cited in the comments of the code in case I forget to 
put any of those links here:

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I tried asking for help on Slack and in the professor's office hours, but didn't really use the Slack help so much. The Slack question was about Bootstrap and Mahika Chimata answered, and while the "col-md-6" comment partially helped, I ended up figuring out my problem after looking back at the lecture demonstrating Bootstrap and also realizing I forgot to download the Bootstrap CSS file.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I'm resubmitting with the late deadline since I forgot to include the Bootstrap CSS file and the three screenshots for the validation checks, so I just want to make sure to point out that if you see this in my README, the repository should be up-to-date now.
I also used VS Code for Education to help me quickly visualize my website, and the link to that is here: https://motivated-mocha-octopus-528.vscodeedu.app/
I used that link to help me do the validation checks.
